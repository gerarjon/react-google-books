# React Google Books

This web application uses the power of React and the Google Books API in order to search for and save books. When the user searches for a book title, they will be presented with books that best match their search and they can save the books to the Mongo database or they can view more information on the books from Google Books. When looking at saved books, they can remove the book from the collection or view the book.
